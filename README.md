In the big data era, scientific experiments and business operations have become the source for large
amounts of  data . With the fast paced increase in data volume, diverse analysis systems has caused
significant challenges in classification. Since existing methods are inefficient and not applicable to large-
scale and especially for incremental data (datastream), a need for efficient method has arised. Mining
massive and high-speed data streams is contemporary challenge in machine learning.
